remarks about sum-even

;This program processes an array of integers, identifies even numbers,
   ;and calculates both their sum and count.
   ;It iterates through the array, checking the least significant bit (LSB) to identify even numbers
   ;adds the even values to a sum, and updates a counter for the total number of even values.
    ;the program displays the sum of even numbers and their count  the screen.
